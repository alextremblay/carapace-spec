# Macros

Macros are basically [Actions](https://rsteube.github.io/carapace/carapace/action.html) exposed to the spec (E.g. [`$files([.go, go.mod])`](https://rsteube.github.io/carapace/carapace/action/actionFiles.html).

The brackets are optional if no argument is passed (so `$files` is equivalent to `$files()`).
